#  Face Recognition System (LBPH + OpenCV)

This is a real-time face recognition system developed using **OpenCV** and the **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)** algorithm. It detects and recognizes faces using a webcam and Haar cascades.

## How It Works

1. **Face Detection**  
   Uses `Haar Cascade` classifier to detect faces from grayscale images.

2. **Face Recognition**  
   Uses `LBPH` algorithm to recognize detected faces based on the training dataset.
